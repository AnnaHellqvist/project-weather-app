# Weather App

The focus for this project was to use a weather API and fetch data into my weather app. 

## The problem

Solved the project iterations first. Got the app to work by adding a few functions with if-statements. Then I wanted to practice more objects and arrays so I added an objects with the styling data for every weater id. And then make an array out of the keys in my object to compare with my current weather id to choose the styling.

If I had more time I would have:
- Try to add more cities
- Explored the ways of using objects/arrays more for this project
- put more effort into styling
